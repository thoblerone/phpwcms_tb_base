# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I try to support all versions of **phpwcms** with security fixes if it can be easily backported. But it's
recommend to update to a current version whenever possible.

On regular basis the following versions of **phpwcms** are supported:

| Version   | Supported          |
|-----------| ------------------ |
| &gt;= 1.9.33 | :white_check_mark: |
| &lt; 1.9.33  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability you can report it by email to <og@phpwcms.org>.

Mostly I am ok with opening an [issue](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/issues)
if the vulnerability isn't accessible in the frontend of **phpwcms**.
